# About

This GTK theme is based on the [Colloid](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Colloid-gtk-theme) theme made by [Vinceliuice](https://github.com/vinceliuice)

## Usage

### Requirements

-   GTK `>=3.20`
-   `gnome-themes-extra` (or `gnome-themes-standard`)
-   Murrine engine

### Installation

1. Download and extract the **Catppuccin-Flavour.zip** file. or **Catppuccin-Flavour-Color.zip** file.
[From Release](https://github.com/sadrach-cl/catppuccin-gtk/releases/) or you can install the theme from the [AUR](#for-arch-linux-users)
2. Move the theme folder to **".themes"** in your home directory. **(~/.themes)** (Skip this step if you are using the AUR package)
3. Select **"Catppuccin-Flavour** or **Catppuccin-Flavour-Color"** via your desktop specific tweaks application (**gnome-tweaks** on Gnome3+).

### For Flatpak users

1. To give your Flatpaks access to your themes folder run:
  ```bash
  sudo flatpak override --filesystem=$HOME/.themes
  ```
2. To set the theme for all Flatpaks, replace `##theme##` with the name of the theme you want to use and run this command:
  ```bash
  sudo flatpak override --env=GTK_THEME=##theme##
  ```
3. For a more in depth tutorial see Hamza Algohary's tutorial on [It's Foss](https://itsfoss.com/flatpak-app-apply-theme/)

### For Arch Linux users

We have 4 AUR packages for all the 4 flavours of the theme:
- [Latte](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/catppuccin-gtk-theme-latte)
- [Frappe](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/catppuccin-gtk-theme-frappe)
- [Macchiato](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/catppuccin-gtk-theme-macchiato)
- [Mocha](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/catppuccin-gtk-theme-mocha)

With your favourite AUR helper, install them:
  ```bash
  yay -S catppuccin-gtk-theme-mocha catppuccin-gtk-theme-macchiato catppuccin-gtk-theme-frappe catppuccin-gtk-theme-latte
  ```

## Development
**Note**: Ensure that you have atleast python version 3.10 installed

Clone the repository using
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:npv12/gtk.git
```
To check out the install script, run 
```bash
python install.py --help
```

You can install any theme like the following example
```bash
python install.py mocha -a sky --tweaks rimless -d ~/.themes
```
You can build all possible variations of the theme possible using the following command and it will output it to releases folder in the root of the repo.
```bash
python build.py
```

A few important notes to keep in mind

* `recolor.py` handles all changes that needs to be done to colloid to ensure it generated catppuccin colors. If vinceliuice changes anything in his theme in future, that is where you must change
* `ctp_colors.py` includes all catppuccin colors and accent. If any colors beside accent is included, ensure it is changed in `get_accent` as well. 
* `var.py` includes all different variables that you can tinker around as per your personal requirements. 
* `create_theme.py` consists of a wrapper that will recolor the colloid theme, install it as per the args provided and rename it accordingly.
