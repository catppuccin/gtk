GTK, while being one of our most popular ports, can only be described as a
nightmare to consistently theme and maintain. To understand why this port has
been archived, please see [#262](https://github.com/catppuccin/gtk/issues/262).

We recognise that users will still want to theme GTK in Catppuccin. This
repository has been heavily refactored to be more maintainable and
understandable by others. The usage and installation instructions can be found
in [docs/USAGE.md](/docs/USAGE.md) and a detailed description of the codebase
structure can be found in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

Good luck.
